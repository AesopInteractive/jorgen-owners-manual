		<h3 id="setup"><strong>A) Theme Installation & Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Two ways to install. Pick your poison.</p>

		<p><strong>Easy Theme Installation (through WordPress)</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Login to your WordPress administration area, and go to Themes-->Appearence</li>
			<li>At the top of the page, select the "Install Themes" tab</li>
			<li>Once you are here, select "Upload," then "Choose File" to locate jorgen.zip on your computer, and install</li>
		</ol>

		<p><strong>Not so Easy (FTP)</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the folder labeled 'jorgen' into the /wp-content/themes/ directory using an FTP client of your choice</li>
			<li>Once uploaded, head into your WordPress administration area, and activate Jorgen under WordPress--->Themes</li>
			<li>Install the recommended plugins as directed by the notice after theme activation</li>
		</ol>

		<p><strong>Install Recommended Plugins</strong></p>
		<p>This theme was built for <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/">Aesop Story Engine</a>, although it can be used without the plugin just as well. So, after installing and activating Jorgen, go ahead and install the Aesop Story Engine plugin. If you've accidentally dismissed the alert to install it, just head to Appearence--->Install Plugins, and you'll be able to install ASE within a couple of clicks.</p>

		<p>The plugin provides all of the core functionality for the story componenets, and Jorgen paints the picture and makes things look awesome. This means you can switch out themes without ever loosing your components!</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="options"><strong>B) Theme Options</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Options can be found under the "Jorgen" heading, within the WordPress theme customizer. Utilizing the customizer provides a simple to use interface, and live previews of your changes as you make them. This also cuts down on code bloat by sticking to native WordPress features. You can get to the customizer within WordPress by going to Appearence-->Customize, or via the front of your site, using the WordPress administration bar up top. Hover over your sites name in the bar, and choose "customize."</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Background - Controls the background color of the site.</li>
			<li>Text - This controls the overall text colors.</li>
			<li>Link - This controls the overall color of the themes links.</li>
			<li>Width - Change the width of the text content within the story.</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="storycover"><strong>C) Story Cover</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>The story cover uses the Featured Image option located in WordPress admin when writing each post. If the image is perhaps too light, or dark, you can add a "mask" and adjust it's opacity, as well as change the color of the text using the custom Story Cover controls. With the Story Cover feature, you can also set a "block style" cover, which slightly resembles a book cover with big, responsive type.</p>

		<p>Start by first setting a cover image using the Featured Image area, then from there, adjust the cover using the controls. Descriptions of these controls are as follows. The unique thing about Jorgen, is that each story can have an independant design. The options below, cover these individual story design options. These options only affect the story that you change them on.</p>

		<h6>Cover Setup</h6>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Cover Text Color</strong> - Controls the color of the text on the story color.</li>
			<li><strong>Story Background Color</strong> - This controls the overall background color of the story.</li>
			<li><strong>Story Text Color</strong> - This controls the overall color of the story text.</li>
			<li><strong>Story Cover Mask Color</strong> - Sometimes your cover image can be too light or dark, so you can apply a "mask" and set the color here. Black, is a great place to start if you're not sure.</li>
			<li><strong>Story Cover Mask Opacity</strong> - After applying the mask, specify the opacity, or how "see through" it is. 0.2 is a great place to start if you're not sure.</li>
		</ul>

		<h6>Cover Layout</h6>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Style</strong> - Jorgen ships with two different cover type styles. You can have it as a "minimal" setup or a "block" style setup. If you choose "block" style, then you can use the options below. Otherwise the options below have no effect. Again, these are specific to each individual story.</li>
			<li><strong>Cover Lines 1 - 5</strong> - If you are using Block cover style, Jorgen will attempt to split the title on its own. However, you can override this with the lines 1-5. Use any, or all lines.</li>
			<li><strong>Maximum Font Size</strong> - If you don't have a lot of text, the font size will likely be ginormous. Put in a maximum, like 400.</li>
			<li><strong>Maximum Title Width</strong> - What't the maximum overall width size of the block style text? Default is 70% of the width of the screen.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="storycontributors"><strong>D) Story Contributors (story footer)</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>The Story Contributors section displays writers, photographers, and illustrators associated with this story.</p>

		<hr />

		<h3 id="updates"><strong>E) Enable Automatic Updates</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Whenever a new udpate is available for this theme, you'll be automatically notified and will be able to update to the new version automatically. To enable updates, the license key provided with your download must be entered and saved.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Login to your WordPress administration area, and go to Appearence-->Jorgen License.</li>
			<li>Save your changes, and your theme will now be enabled to recieve automatic updates.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="advanced"><strong>F) Advanced Usage</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>If you're reading this then it's assumed that you are a theme developer, and you understand what hooks, filters, and CSS preprocessors are. This theme has advanced functionality built-in, so read on to see how you can take advantage of this and make your life easy.</p>

		<h5 class="sub-heading">DevTools</h5>
		<p>Included in your download, is a folder called "DevTools." Inside this folder are two files; package.json, and Gruntfile.js. If you do not know what Grunt is, then just ignore these files. If you do know what Grunt is, and you use it with your workflow, then just drop these two files into the "assets" directory of Jorgen. After they are there, run your npm install to install the node depencies, and you'll then be set to start working with the core LESS files. </p>

		<p>I HIGHLY recommend first making a child theme, and copying over at least the assets directory so your changes will stay safe with theme updates.</p>

		<h5 class="sub-heading">LESS</h5>
		<p>The styles are built with LESS. They're built with LESS vs SASS because LESS is easier for new folks to learn, and it's syntax is shorter. Within the theme folder, you'll find the assets directory. Within the assets directory, you'll find the LESS and CSS directories. Inside the LESS directory, there's a folder called "source" which contains most of Twitter Boostrap 3.0. These files are then imported into the style.less file, where the rest of the sites styles live.</p>

		<p>The style.less file is compiled into the style.css file that's enqueued by the theme. It's highly recommended to use a CSS preprocessor like Codekit, or a task runner such as Grunt, to compile these files. It's also important to know that ALL of the sites colors, can be controlled via the variables.less file, located within assets/less/source directory. </p>

		<h5 class="sub-heading">Child Themes</h5>
		<p>Setting up a child theme is the recommended way of manipulating and changing the layout. This keeps your changes in tact when a new theme update is available. We have included both a style.css and a functions.php in the "jorgen child" folder. Setting up a child theme is as easy as pasting the following in a new style.css file, in a new theme.</p>

		<pre>
			/*
			    Theme Name: Jorgen Child
			    Theme URI:
			    Author:
			    Author URI:
			    Description: A child theme for Jorgen
			    Version: 1.0
			    License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
			    License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
			    Template: jorgen
			*/
		</pre>

		<p>Then set up a functions.php file to enqueue this stylesheet.</p>

		<pre>
			<?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'jorgen_child_theme_styles' );
function jorgen_child_theme_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/css/style.css' );
    wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style', get_stylesheet_uri(), array( 'parent-style' ) );
}
		</pre>

		<hr>

		<p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the themes on ThemeForest, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
